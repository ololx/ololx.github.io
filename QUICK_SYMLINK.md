# Quick Symlink

The Quick Symlink is a Finder Extension  which allows to create symbolic links of selected folders or files. It could be called by right-clicking on selected folders or files and selecting `Quick Symlink` from the contextual menu. **It is a remaster of the other project - `create-symlink`; for more details see https://github.com/ololx/create-symlink.**

For me the symbolic links is a useful feature of macOS. They can be especially useful when it's needed to store the `Documents` folder on a hard drive or SD card, but on the ssd to create a just link to this folder.
Of course, creating symbolic links via the terminal is very easy and convenient. But this does not negate the fact that it could be even easier and more comfortable through interaction with the GUI.

This GIF demonstrates how the `Quick Symlink` allows quite simple to select files or folders and paste symlink in the current directory.
