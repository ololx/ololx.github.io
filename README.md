# Welcome

This resource contains a short description of only my open source projects. All these projects are at the stage when they are already being used by my personal me. Anyone can also use these projects and help with their development.

If you want to somehow help in the development of a project, then just follow the link to the corresponding repository and read the rules of contribution in README (the link will be provided).

You can also see my pet projects, which are made for fun or do not yet meet the minimum usability requirements to upload them here. To do this, just go to my GitHub profile at the following link - [https://github.com/ololx](https://github.com/ololx).

             The Cranberry          
```

The Cranberry is a java library that allows to write less code - it's  automatically plugs into your project build and sweets up your java.

The gif demonstraits how `cranberry` helps to write less code on the checking parameters implementation example for non-emptiness via usage of the `@ NotEmpty` annotation from the `cranberry-statement` module. This is one of opportunities which cranberry provides.

# Quick Symlink

The Quick Symlink is a Finder Extension  which allows to create symbolic links of selected folders or files. It could be called by right-clicking on selected folders or files and selecting `Quick Symlink` from the contextual menu. **It is a remaster of the other project - `create-symlink`; for more details see https://github.com/ololx/create-symlink.**

For me the symbolic links is a useful feature of macOS. They can be especially useful when it's needed to store the `Documents` folder on a hard drive or SD card, but on the ssd to create a just link to this folder.
Of course, creating symbolic links via the terminal is very easy and convenient. But this does not negate the fact that it could be even easier and more comfortable through interaction with the GUI.

This GIF demonstrates how the `Quick Symlink` allows quite simple to select files or folders and paste symlink in the current directory.

This GIF demonstrates how the `Quick Symlink` allows quite simple to copy files or folders and paste symlink somewhere.

This GIF demonstrates how the `Quick Symlink` allows quite simple to copy files or folders, paste them somewhere, and replace them with symlinks.
